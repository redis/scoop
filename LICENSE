(ii) Redis Cloud as described [here](https://redis.io/cloud/); or
(iii) Redis Software as described [here](https://redis.io/enterprise/):
(collectively, the “Redis Services”), provided that such usage is not additionally made
in connection or combination with a Competitive Offering.

A “Competitive Offering” is a Product that is offered to third parties on either a
paid basis, including through paid support arrangements, or a non-paid basis,
